      Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since October 19th, 2007. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed over 2.5 million commits, opened over 1 million issues, submitted roughly 650k pull requests across 4357 repositories from over 50 countries 🤯. But that's just us. We are proud to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system 🪐.

    Finance
GitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[20]

In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital[6] with a $750 million valuation.[21]

In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[22][23] The round valued the company at approximately $2 billion.[24]

As of 2023, GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue.[2]
