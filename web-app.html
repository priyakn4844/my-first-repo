      Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we‚Äôve been doing this since October 19th, 2007. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed over 2.5 million commits, opened over 1 million issues, submitted roughly 650k pull requests across 4357 repositories from over 50 countries ü§Ø. But that's just us. We are proud to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system ü™ê.

      Structure of the organization
           GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management.[17] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries.[18]
          In 2014, the company added a layer of middle management in response to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership. As a result of the scandal, Tom Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.[19]
