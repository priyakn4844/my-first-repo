      Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since October 19th, 2007. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed over 2.5 million commits, opened over 1 million issues, submitted roughly 650k pull requests across 4357 repositories from over 50 countries 🤯. But that's just us. We are proud to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system 🪐.
